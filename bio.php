                            <p> I grew up playing baseball all around the Southern California area. I went to Chino Hills
                                High School where I played on the varsity baseball team for three years. I was involved with 
                                a few charitable organizations throughout this time, including Habitat for Humanity and 
                                The Heroes Baseball program at Chino Hills High School.

                            <p> I am a Junior at Pitzer College in Claremont, California. It is part of the Claremont College
                                Consortium, where I am majoring in computer science at Harvey Mudd College. I am a right handed
                                pitcher for the Pomona-Pitzer collegiate baseball team. We play in the SCIAC NCAA divison-three 
                                conference.

                            <p> I have played baseball since I was about 7 or 8 years old. I love the strategy behind the game,
                                and I constantly search for a competitive edge over the other team. My High School team went to the 
                                state championship while I was a Junior. I have played on a handful of the premier baseball teams
                                prior to college including the San Gabriel Valley Arsenal and the Red Sox Scout Ball team. I was 
                                a San Gabriel Valley Tribune regional all-star in High School.

                            <p>
                                In the summer of 2015, I experienced 
                                a traumatic injury to my pitching shoulder that had occurred throughout the previous season. I tore almost two-thirds of my labrum in my shoulder from constant overuse and other factors. I underwent a 
                                full SLAP repair and a year of agonizing rehabilitation, which obviously cut my High School baseball experience short. Throwing resumed in the fall of my first year as a Sagehen, only to bring a new problem. I understood that throwing after an extended period of time would bring pain, however, I knew something wasn't quite right with my shoulder. Many MRI's and office visits later, it was concluded that my labrum was torn again for a second time with additional complications with the previous anchors and new bone spurs. After another year and a half after my second surgery, I was willing to try it again. This time was still painful and tedious like the first, but 
                                I was making progress with pain and performance. I was on the cusp of being cut from the college team because of the situation, there was no way that a 5'10" pitcher that was throwing 68 mph in the fall with pain could continue to play college baseball. I was substantially behind in performance compared to my previous years on the mound, and it was clear that I had little time, 4 months to be exact, to get back to a level that could play. I went to work every day with combinations of the Jaeger Arm program and
                                Driveline plyocare routines while struggling in the classroom to get work done. There's only so much time in the day for improvement, and I had to budget my time often skipping time to work on assignments to get my workouts in. Bi-weekly commutes from Claremont to Chino Hills to work on pitching mechanics and studying slow-motion video of towel-drills and bullpens were time-consuming and led to a lot of sleepless nights involving finishing leftover homework and projects due the following day. It became apparent that my roommates were having to deal with a stressed-out emotional wreck constantly and my mental health and overall stance on life were quite dismal. The results started to come slowly when the "Why me?" questions changed to "So what?". When the team was making it's cuts, I made the team. I was on the 
                                mound throwing 82-84mph with a lot more work to do going into the season. It felt good showcasing my worth and hardwork, however what the team thought of me at that point had little relevance to my situation. I stopped worrying and kept working, knowing that I could overcome whatever was thrown my way, and when I proved to myself that I finally got back to a competitive level I got the chance to reflect on a long and brutal road. I'm glad I reached the point of arm health and happiness that day, so I could potentially teach my children to play the great game when I am older if they so choose to.

                                In a way, starting baseball at an early age made me go through this injury without a doubt. The stress on developing ligaments and body parts year-round in sunny california definitely played a role. 
                                However, I can not deny the priceless lessons about life that came from it either. This injury has played a prominant role with my fascination with data science in baseball. I would like to be able to save many developing pitchers from years of struggling to play the game they love by trying to prevent injuries like this from happening. Also, I would like to stay around this game as long as possible. Baseball is a special sport that continues teaching you about various parts of life that may seem unrelated to sports at all.
